Zsh Customizations and Useful Packages

I'm using Oh My ZSH (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) along with customizations from yadr (https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) as well as my own customizations.

Feel free to use any or all of these customizations for your command line.

I also use a lot of packages from Homebrew, and I use several gems.

Feel free to use the install script, but note that it was built for Mac OS X, and XCode as well as XCode's Command Line Tools need to be installed. I also highly recommend looking through the install script and reading my comments.

Alternatively, you can download and customize the install script yourself before running it.

### Install via curl

curl -L https://raw.github.com/fuelingtheweb/fuelingzsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh
