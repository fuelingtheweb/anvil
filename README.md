Compiler for Karabiner.edn (used by Goku) plus Zsh Customizations and Useful Packages

I'm using Oh My ZSH (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) along with my own customizations.

Feel free to use any or all of these customizations for your command line.

I also use a lot of packages from Homebrew.

Note that the install script is highly customized for my setup.
